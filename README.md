Monty Hall Simulator
---------------

monty_hall_simulation.py is a simulation script to prove the winning "switch" hypothesys.
What it states is, itâ€™s actually to your benefit to switch:
* If you switch, you have roughly a 2/3 chance of winning the car.
* If you stick to your original choice you have roughly a 1/3 chance of winning the car.

But how? [Bayes' theorem][0] can answer this question
